# How i created it

i used four different functions,
two of the functions work together and they create a navigation

one smoothscroll function connects the section and botton using smoothscrolltoview
and the last function changes the background color of the navigation bottons

# How it Functions

to understand how it works you have to go to the inspection and see how
classes automaticly adds or removes when you scroll
this project i worked mainly javascript, and some little css
for the toggle classes like navstyle.
