#landingpage project
this project i created a landingpage
it creats dynamicly a navigation throught javascript code

i used four different functions,
two of the functions work together and they create a navigation

one smoothscroll function connects the section and botton using smoothscrolltoview
and the last function changes the background color of the navigation bottons

the program allows you to click a button and it will
navigate you directly to section

to understand how it works you have to go to the inspection and see how 
classes automaticly adds or removes when you scroll
this project i worked mainly javascript, and some little css
for the toggle classes like navstyle.
